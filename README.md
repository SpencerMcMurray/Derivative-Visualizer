# Derivative Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for higher order derivative approximations.

We will be using Python to create a backend which can calculate and send
the approximation and the true derivative of a given function to the frontend,
where we visualize our results.

## Getting started

To install the dependencies you need to run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm i
```

Then to run the client or the server run either

```
npm run client
OR
npm run server
```
